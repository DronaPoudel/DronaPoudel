# Hi there, I'm Drona Poudel ðŸ‘‹
 
I'm a passionate JavaScript/UI/MERN developer, constantly learning and building things with code. Welcome to my GitHub profile!
 
<!--I'll call myself an inquisitive hustler. I believe in the third eye, a different perspective of thinking to solve even trivial problems. 
Rather than working on a solution, I spend more time analyzing the problem. 
To me, bearing an interest with dedication in a field of opportunity is more important than working in a field of interest. 
It is not my genre to limit our opportunity and thought simply by defining an interest. Omniscient intrigues me more than specialist.
